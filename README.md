# CS-350
This project was very basic and it was intended to set up the board, make it communicate, and write code the would make lights blink and change its intensity. I think I did well writing the additional code that was needed. Since this was my first time programming an embedded system, I would need to work on more similar projects to improve my skills. To help with this I will take some more time  to analyze the docs and find online tutorials that I can easily follow. This project really tested my problem solving/debugging skills. Lots of research and lots of trial and error was needed to get it to work due to version compatibility issues. Although it was very frustrating, this experience gave me an idea of the type of issues that I will encounter in future roles.
